Today is review and VYTRACK automation practice
This is what I used the most.
EXAMPLE: List<Map<String, String>> - for data tables. (from DB, from Excel file or from cucumber data tables.)
Scenario: Verify for store manager
Login as story manager
Go to Activities --> Calls
Verify that Log Call button is displayed
Go to Activities --> Calendar Events
Verify that Create Calendar Event button is displayed
Poem: My code.
Ice cream for kids
Flowers for ladies
Code for geeks...
 Thread.sleep(seconds * 1000 ); means put on hold thread.
 What is thread? It's a path of code execution.
 Java supports multi-threading. That means multiple tasks can be executed at the same time.

"Test case: Save and Cancel options
Login as sales manager
Go to Activities --> Calendar Events
Click on Create Calendar Event
Verify Cancel button is displayed
Verify Save And Close button is displayed
Verify Save And Close dropdown option is displayed
Verify Save And New dropdown option is displayed
Verify Save dropdown option is displayed
One thing that I want to emphasize that it's not final structure of automation framework. We don't design our framework based on class. Any duplication has been done due to practice purpose.
